# **Music Genre Image Classifier**

This project uses images fetched from the flickr API using musical genres as a query. Training a machine learning model on these images extracts some
visual representation of a musical genre. Electron Music, for example, was common in images with neon blues and certain dark spots. With the limitation of
available computing power, I didn't use as large of a training set as would be necessary to truly find a relation between a visual and a musical genre.
There was some correlation, however, as the accuracy peaked at ~40% a metric I consider strong considering the subjectivity of the models classification.
